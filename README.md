# Insurance_Medical_Data_Storage

1. Designed a big data application aimed at storing and managing vast amounts of medical insurance plans, leveraging the synergies of Java, Kafka, and Elasticsearch.
2. Incorporated a JSON validator to ensure the integrity and accuracy of incoming insurance data before committing it to the database. Once validated and stored, the data is seamlessly transitioned to a dedicated Elasticsearch service via Kafka.
3. Implemented OAuth 2.0 to guarantee robust authentication and authorization, ensuring data security. Enhanced data integrity by adding the ETag feature during the insurance storage process.
4. Tools Used: Java, Kafka, Elasticsearch, OAuth 2.0, ETag, JSON Validator.
